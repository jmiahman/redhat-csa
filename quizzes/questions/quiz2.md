======

1) Swap space can be created out of GPT, MBR and LVM based partitions/volumes.

      True

   or

      False

2) Which file system is best used with LVM volumes?


3) What are two ways to find information about swap devices enabled on the system?


4) Which tool(s) would you use to mange GPT based partitions?


5) The file system needs to be created on the device only after the Logical Volume is created (lvcreate).


6) You're in the middle of the Red Hat certification test and forget which LVM commands you need to use in order to perform the specified tasks. What option(s) do you have?


7) Select the correct order of tasks for creating an LVM for the first time.


8) How many primary partitions can a GPT partition table have?


9) After adding 50GB more of physical storage to your existing volume group, you need to extend your /dev/battlestar/galactica volume group to include an additional 20GB of storage. How might you accomplish this task?


10) What is the maximum disk size for a GPT based partition?


11) You are extending a logical volume. In order to do this, you have to add the /dev/xvdj device to the volume group "battlestar". What command would you issue in order to accomplish this task?


12) Which file on the operating system contains information about partitions the OS is reading?


13) After making partition changes, the partition changes do not appear in the /proc/partitions. How can you force the kernel to reload the partition tables?


14) You've just increased the size of the /dev/battlestar/galactica LVM volume. This volume is mounted in /mnt/mydir; what commands would you issue in order for the operating system and files system to recognize the increase in size on the device?


15) Which command displays information about a swap device?


16) What command(s) is used to inform the OS of partition table changes?


17) For an MBR partition, what is the max disk size a partition can be?


18) Which command is used to assign a swap signature to a device?


19) Given the volume group "battlestar" and a physical volume in the volume group "/dev/xvdf1", which command would accurately create a 19G logical volume out of /dev/xvdf1 with a volume name of "galactica"?


20) What is the limit for primary partitions when using the MBR partition type?
